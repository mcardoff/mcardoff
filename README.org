* Me
Hi! I am Michael, a 22 year old Physics graduate student at Brandeis University. I completed my undergraduate at Illinois Tech. I am in my first year as a graduate student, but I am hoping to work in Experimental Particle Physics.

For a look at my previous research, you can check out my [[https://github.com/mcardoff/Research][research repo]].
* Programming Languages
I am fairly familiar with all of the following programming languages to some extent, in no particular order
- C/C++
- Cuda C
- Emacs/elisp
- GNU Octave
- Haskell
- LaTeX
- Mathematica (Wolfram Language)
- Python
- Swift/SwiftUI
